# Python Tsunami 2019

Material of the three day python course at Copenhagen Universities, Faculty of Health and Medical Science

## Objectives

- Become familiar with the fundamental software tools of data science (the terminal, REPLs, scripts, and interactive notebooks, and IDEs) and how to apply these tools to data analysis and simulation problems.
- Learn to describe the fundamental ideas behind the most common data structures (including strings, lists, dictionaries, arrays, and data frames), and select the data structures and associated Python libraries that best fit their analysis questions.
- Become able to produce attractive, informative data visualizations and statistical reports, take abstract statistics problems and write algorithms to solve as well as discuss them in a group, using Python as a collaboration tool.
